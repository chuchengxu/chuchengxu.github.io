## 摘要 (Abstract)

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) path planning in complex environments requires efficient optimization algorithms. In this paper, we propose an **Improved Dung Beetle Optimizer (IDBO)** based on the Fuch chaotic map to enhance the global search capability and convergence speed. 

Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed IDBO algorithm outperforms standard DBO and other meta-heuristic algorithms in finding optimal collision-free paths in 3D environments.
